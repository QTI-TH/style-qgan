# qgmc 

- **Discriminator (D) development:** 
  - single qubit "wire" to output 0 or 1. 
  - use re-uploading for this task

The initial upload is the tutorial implementation of the re-uploading classifier in qibo. Based on this we should be able to learn how to classify also other scenarios and to write our own code to perform the task.

To-do list:
- Simplify the tutorial by removing unused options in "mod.py" (which is a copy of main)
- Reduce to one dataset
- Implement new dataset, ideally a simplified/idealised version of our even data
- Train and run qlassifier
