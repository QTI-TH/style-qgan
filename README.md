## Tutorial

We have prepared a notebook with a [complete tutorial](https://github.com/QTI-TH/style-qgan/blob/main/tutorial_notebook/style-qGAN-Tutorial.ipynb
) for the style-qGAN training and inference.

## This repository

This repository contains prototypes of qGAN models using [Qibo](https://github.com/qiboteam/qibo).
